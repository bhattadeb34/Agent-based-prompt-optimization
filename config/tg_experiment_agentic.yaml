    '*' marks the repeat-unit attachment points (two per SMILES, PolyInfo convention).
    Every generated SMILES MUST contain exactly two '*' characters.
    The goal is to maximise glass transition temperature (Tg in °C).
    Higher Tg → better thermal stability, mechanical strength, and potential use in
    high-performance films, membranes, and structural composites.
    Structural features that raise Tg: rigid aromatic backbones, bulky pendant groups,
    cyclic structures, hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors, strong inter-chain interactions.
    Avoid: long flexible aliphatic chains, excessive ether linkages without compensating
    rigidity, low-MW substituents that plasticise the chain.
    Example high-Tg SMILES:
      *c1ccc(C(=O)Nc2ccc(*)cc2)cc1
      *OC(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)O*)cc1
      *c1ccc(Oc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)c3ccc(*)cc3)cc2)cc1

    Generate polymer repeat-unit SMILES (with exactly two '*') to maximise
    glass transition temperature (Tg in °C).
    Prefer rigid aromatic backbones, imide/amide linkages, and bulky cyclic groups.
    Each SMILES must contain exactly two '*'.
