    [Cu] and [Au] are SYMBOLIC PLACEHOLDERS for polymer backbone connection points.
    They are NOT actual copper or gold atoms — they mark where repeat units join.
    Every generated SMILES MUST contain exactly one [Cu] and one [Au].
    The goal is to maximise Li-ion conductivity by modifying the polymer architecture:
    ether oxygen content, chain flexibility, polar side groups, and backbone connectivity.
    Example valid SMILES:
      CC(CO[Cu])CSCCOC(=O)[Au]
      CC(CO[Cu])COCCOC(=O)[Au]
      O=C([Au])NCCCCNC(=O)CCCN[Cu]

    Generate polymer SMILES that maximise Li-ion conductivity while
    maintaining structural similarity to the parent.
    Focus on: ether oxygen density, backbone flexibility, polar pendant groups.
    Each SMILES must contain exactly one [Cu] and one [Au].
